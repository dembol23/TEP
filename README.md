# Effective Programming Techniques (TEP) - Course Projects

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the Effective Programming Techniques course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. The projects progress from manual memory management in C++98 to advanced template programming and modern C++11 move semantics. All implementations strictly follow a policy of no unjustified exceptions and prioritize high-quality object-oriented design.
## List 1: Dynamic Allocation and Memory Management
This assignment focuses on the mechanics of dynamic memory allocation using the `new` and `delete` operators. It explores the differences between stack and heap allocation, as well as the implementation of multi-dimensional arrays using double pointers. The project includes the development of the first `Table` class, which manages an integer array and demonstrates the use of default, parameterized, and copy constructors to prevent memory leaks
## List 2: Operator Overloading and Large Numbers
The second list introduces operator overloading as a tool to create more intuitive and readable code. The primary task is the creation of a `Number` class capable of storing and performing arithmetic on arbitrarily large integers stored in dynamic arrays. It requires manual implementation of the assignment operator and arithmetic symbols like `+, -, *, and /`, ensuring that operations do not rely on standard integer types which would limit the numerical range.
## List 3: Prefix Notation Expression Trees
This project involves building a system to parse and evaluate mathematical formulas provided in Polish (prefix) notation. Using `Tree` and `Node` classes, the program constructs a non-binary tree where operators serve as internal nodes and variables or constants serve as leaves. The implementation features an object-oriented parsing mechanism that automatically repairs incomplete expressions by adding default values or ignoring redundant arguments.
## List 4: Template Programming and Generic Results
The fourth assignment extends the previous work by utilizing C++ templates to allow for reusable, type-independent code. A key component is the `Result` template class, which encapsulates either a successful return value or a list of error objects. This list also explores template specialization, specifically for void types, to handle methods that do not return a value but may still encounter errors during execution.
## List 5: Smart Pointers and Move Semantics
This list introduces modern C++ features, specifically the automation of memory management through custom smart pointers and the optimization of resource transfers. By implementing a template-based smart pointer with reference counting, the project eliminates manual delete calls and prevents double-free errors. Additionally, it introduces move semantics through move constructors and move assignment operators, significantly reducing the overhead of copying large data structures like expression trees
## Mini-Project: LcVRP Genetic Algorithm Optimizer
The final project is a comprehensive optimizer for the Limited Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (LcVRP) based on a Genetic Algorithm. It integrates the skills from all previous lists, including custom memory management and object-oriented design, to evolve a population of solutions through crossover and mutation. The system consists of a `GeneticAlgorithm` manager, a `Instance` class representing potential solutions, and a `Evaluator` to load and score problem instances
